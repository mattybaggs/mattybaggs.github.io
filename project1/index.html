	<H5>Bartlett's Only MVP</H5>
	<p>Shakespeare shaped the language.
	Some say he invented it.
	Wilde and Shaw spun expressions of unrelenting wit.
	Whitman taught the mother tongue
	How to sing for us;
	Yeats scaled the beauty of her lonely peaks.
	Joyce uncovered something,
	And so did Eliot
	<p></p>
	<p>But unlike Yogi, none of them could hit.</p>
