	<h1>The Yogi Poems</h1>
	<h2>Zen and the Art of Baseball</h2>

	<h3>Bartlett's Only MVP</h3>
	<p>Shakespeare shaped the language.<br>
	Some say he invented it.</br>
	Wilde and Shaw spun expressions of unrelenting wit.<br>
	Whitman taught the mother tongue</br>
	How to sing for us;<br>
	Yeats scaled the beauty of her lonely peaks.</br>
	Joyce uncovered something,<br>
	And so did Eliot</br></p>
	<p></p>
	<p>But unlike Yogi, none of them could hit.</p>
