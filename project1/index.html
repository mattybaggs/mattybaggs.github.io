	<H5>Bartlett's Only MVP</H5>
	<p>Shakespeare shaped the language.</p>
	<p>Some say he invented it.
	<p>Wilde and Shaw spun expressions of unrelenting wit.</p>
	<p>Whitman taught the mother tongue</p>
	<p>How to sing for us;</p>
	<p>Yeats scaled the beauty of her lonely peaks.</p>
	<p>Joyce uncovered something,</p>
	<p>And so did Eliot</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>But unlike Yogi, none of them could hit.</p>
