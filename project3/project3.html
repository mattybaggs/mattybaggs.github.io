<h1>Bartlett's Only MVP</h1>
<p>Shakespeare shaped the language.<br>
Some say he invented it.
<br><br>
Wilde and Shaw spun expressions<br>
of unrelenting wit.
<br><br>
Whitman taught the mother tongue<br>
how to sing for us;
<br><br>
Yeats scaled the beauty of her lonely peaks.<br>
<br>
Joyce uncovered something new,<br>
And so did Eliot.
<br><br>
But unlike Yogi, none of them could hit.<br>
<br>
-Raphael Badagliacca</p>
